Hi, this is Leonardo.

### What this post is about?

Eight simple tips on how to structure your word day and your free time.

### What can you do?

1. Not over plan, think small and simple are key to succeed. For example, trying to accomplish from 3 to 5 important tasks is enough. You are not running a sprint, itâ€™s a marathon.
2. Plan just the week in front of you, long term plans are not good because itâ€™s hard to stick to it. You are not running a sprint, itâ€™s a marathon.
3. After that, choose something rewarding to do, but remember it is better to privilege healthy activity.

> Exercise, interestingly, also helps new neurons survive. Exercise is by far, more effective than any drug on the market today to help you >learn better. It benefits all of your vital organisms, not just your brain.

4. Try to stay focus when working, it's better spend less time focusing but with more quality. Remember that every time you are distracted from your main task, it cost you more effort to return into the previous focus state.
5. For that, maybe is better avoid smartphone while working / studying, for example you can use phone time like a reward after x time spent focusing. Also try to put your mobile phone in â€˜do not disturbâ€™ mode, itâ€™s helping.
6. Be clear with yourself, what you expect and want from you and your day, my suggestion is to write it down, and it doesn't matter if on a paper or on a display.

> At the moment Iâ€™m using a calendar app that is minimal and that keeps out noise that other apps have, itâ€™s called [Teux Deux](https://teuxdeux.com/).

7. Sleep is an important part of your learning and memory process. Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn.
8. And as always, drink more water.

### Conclusion

What is key is that you need to have a kind of organization of what matters for you, and try to stick it to it or at least, try to follow a kind of plan / organization.

Sometimes it could become too hard to follow, but this is also normal, donâ€™t worry and donâ€™t be stressed about it.
That's it.

I'm new to this kind of blog post stuff, and I'm not English native, therefore I'm trying to keep everything simple.
