Hi there! I'm Leonardo.
I'm a passionate learner that love to experiment new things.

### My past

<mark>My background</mark> is really far from tech, back to 2017 I was an
online poker player. I know it's shocking, but I was so anti-tech that I
remember that for every kind of problem I turned off my PC (It still works
sometimes).

After <mark>years of travelling ✈️</mark> around the world and thousands of
euro won with poker I understood that money were not so important for my
self, and that if I would achieve happiness I had to change the main focus
in my life.

### An interior crisis

Therefore, I started to <mark>question my self</mark> about what I was
doing, and if was right for my soul.

During this process, at the end of 2017, I started to grow an interest in
blockchain and without to have a real understanding I invested and lost some
money.

### The discovery

After that, if I understand something was that know about crypto it would
happen only if I would start studying about programming from the basics
and only then try to understand more complex concepts like crypto and
blockchain.

Now here we are, I'm super happy for my decision and really excited (Ohh
I'm so thrilled!!!) every day to <mark>learn and understand</mark> new
tools and languages.
