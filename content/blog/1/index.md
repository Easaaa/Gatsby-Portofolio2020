Hi there! I'm Leonardo.
I’m a passionate learner that loves to experiment new things.

### My past

<mark>My background</mark> is really far from tech, back to 2017 I was an online poker player. I know it’s shocking. At that time, I was really anti-tech. I remember that for every kind of problem I turned off my PC thinking that it was the smartest solution.

By the way, it still works sometimes.

After <mark>years of travelling ✈️</mark> around the world and thousands of euro won with poker I understood that money were not so important for my self and that, if I would achieve happiness I had to change the main focus in my life.

### An interior crisis

Therefore, I started to question what I was doing, and if it was right for my soul.

During this process, at the end of 2017, I started to grow an interest in blockchain and without having a real understanding <mark>I invested and lost a lot of money</mark>, but you know, money goes and comes.

### The discovery

After that, I understood that to master crypto and blockchain it would be mandatory studying about programming from the fundamentals, and only then try to approach more complex concepts and languages like <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity" target="_blank" title='Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts.'>solidity</a>.

Now here we are, I’m super happy with my decision and really excited every day to learn and understand new tools and languages.
