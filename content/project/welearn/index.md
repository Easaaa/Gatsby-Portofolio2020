Before finding my first job in tech, I always thought that to achieve my goal was necessary to grow my experience in a bigger project, with code written for the front-end but also for the backend. Therefore, I thought to build a video course platform where people could add content on an admin web app, and then interact with it on the front web app.

### How is made it?

- Gatsby
- Netlify
- Apollo
- Firebase Firestore
- Firebase Auth

I'm not totally sure about this stack, but at the time it was interesting to me starting to understand apollo and graphql.

### Why I built it?

I built it to challenge my self on making a full web app with new technologies, developing the front end and the back end. Also, at that time I was intrigued to sell the product at some friends in the poker community.

Below a short video of how the admin app works. You can find the follow functionalities:

1. Authentication (Firebase).
2. Creation of new users.
3. A profile section where each user can modify some credentials.
4. The user receives an email with his credentials.
5. A section where upload and add new videos.
6. The course creation, where add different modules with a live preview component.

Follow the front web app, where the final users can interact and enjoy what the app offer, like a video and course library, with filters and a search bar.

### What I've learned?

I learned how to structure a big project. Maybe the most important lesson was how to don't structure a project and how to pick the right
tech stack without add complexity that is not needed. I could very well have just used firebase firestore function to query and mutate data.
