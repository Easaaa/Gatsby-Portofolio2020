Before finding my first job in tech, I always thought that to achieve my goal was necessary grow experience in bigger project, with
code written for the front-end but also for the backend.
Therefore I thought to build a video courses where people could interact with an admin web app where to add content for users on
the front web app.

### How is made it?

- Gatsby
- Netlify
- Apollo
- Firebase Firestore
- Firebase Auth

I'm not totally sure about this stack, but at the time it was interesting to me starting to understand apollo and graphql, for that it was worthy it.

### Why I built it?

I built it to challenge my self on making a full web app, adding new tech where I had to learn how to interact with each one and how to
making interact each others.

This is a short video presentation of how the admin app works. You can find the follow functionalities:

1. Authentication (Firebase).
2. Creation of new users.
3. A profile section where each user can modify some credentials.
4. Also the users receive an email with his credentials.
5. A section where you can upload and add new videos.
6. A the end the courses creation, where you can add different modules with a live preview component.

And this is the front app, where the final users can interact and enjoy what the app offer, like a video and course library, with filters and a search bar.

<script src="https://fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

### What I've learned?

I learned how structure a big project, but maybe the most important lesson was how don't structure a project and how to pick the right
tech stack without add complexity that is not need it.
