I made this app to solve a problem that my girlfriend and I had before summer (2019), we thought that it would be cool to have a simple app to find where to go in Barcelona, during a sunny day, and then we started adding more categories. At the moment Iâ€™m rebuilding this app, with a new style and new functionalities.
