I made this app to solve a problem that my girlfriend and I had before summer (2019), we thought that it would be cool have a simple app to find where to go in Barcelona, during a sunny day, and then we start adding more categories. At the moment I'm rebuilding this app, with a new style and new functionality.

### How is made it?

project.

In short:

3.  Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung
4.  Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
