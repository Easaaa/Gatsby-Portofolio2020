  <Text>
    Hi there! I'm Leonardo. I'm a passionate learner that love experiment new
    things. <mark>My background</mark> is really far from tech, back to 2017 I
    was an <mark>online poker player.</mark> I was so anti tech that I remember
    a day where while I was playing poker the PC turned off unexpectedly, I was
    so furious that to fix that I was punching the case üòÇ. Don't worry, now I
    practice meditation since a while, I'm more <mark> quiet and calm üßò.</mark>
    <br></br> <br></br>
    After <mark>years of travelling ‚úàÔ∏è</mark> around the world and thousand of
    euro won with poker I understood that money were not so important to achieve
    happiness in my life. Therefore I started to <mark>question my self</mark>{' '}
    about what I was doing, and if was right for my soul. <br></br> At the end
    of 2017, I started to grow an interest in blockchain and cryptocurrencies ‚Çø.
    Obviously I didn't understand at all how all the thing was working but I
    invested and lost some money anyway. Then I thought it was better start{' '}
    <mark>studying programming</mark> from the basics and only try to understand
    more complex concepts like crypto and blockchain.
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    Now here we are, I'm super happy for my decision and really excited every
    day to <mark>learn and understand</mark> new subject.
